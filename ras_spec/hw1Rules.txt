!N and |N will not be in the same line

the environment variable will not be only PATH, but also others.
but in one time we should only consider one environment variable.
(can be implement by a array)

the '>' will overwrite the exist file if it need to.
(ie : there is a test.txt, and our command is "ls tmp.txt > test.txt")
and '>' will only occur in the end of the line,
also, it willnot be the first word of commands

"printenv" "setenv" and "exit" will occur only without other commands.

the excuting file should be put in 0556091, 
when it is excuted, use "chdir" to change the path to the ras/.

if one wrong command occurs in the command line, 
the whole output only should be the error msg.

welcome msg only need to be in three lines.
